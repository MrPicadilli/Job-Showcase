# My Amazing Project : RENFORCE

This project was created for a research paper on the field of reflexivity in VR. It leverages shader and line renderer component to simulate the wobbling and pouring liquids in beaker. Explore the demo below to see it in action!

I also made a tutorial to learn all the possible fonctionality of the main application with an interactive scenario which update automatically in function of the advancement of the player.

The code is not linked because it belongs to the LIRIS

## Key Features
- **Feature 1**: Liquids wobble inside theircontainer and pour outside the container.
- **Feature 2**: Fluid exchange between container is realist in term of quantity and we made an approximation of pH whish was verified and accepted by a specialist.
- **Feature 3**: Point system where the points updates themselves if the player do certain task.
- **Feature 4**: Tracing system of each movement/ interaction of the player which is recorded on an excel file.

## Challenges and Learnings
This project helped me deepen my understanding of the constraints of developping in VR and also on the field of the research. A major challenge was to make a liquid mechanism realist enough to not inconvenience the player, which I solved by using the shader graph on unity and the line renderer. And the fluid exchange was made with some proportional calculation that i created by myself whitout any knowledge in chemistry.
